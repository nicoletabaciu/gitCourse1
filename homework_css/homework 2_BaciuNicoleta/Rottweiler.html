				<p>The strong and loyal Rottweiler is one of the best guard dogs to be found. This tough powerhouse of a breed is known for its strength, but underneath that solidly built exterior is a truly devoted dog that is both playful and loving. The Rottweiler can quickly be picked out of a crowd by its shiny black coat, rust colored markings, and strongly-built frame.  Incredibly intelligent, confident, and adaptable this breed is an excellent choice for working, and for families alike. Broad chested and compactly built, this breed can pack a punch in its power and strength! But they love to use all of their energy for things like playing with the family or working hard. They are working dogs, and like to be given direction. Provide them enough exercise, mental stimulation, and time, and they will be your loyal companions forever.</p>
