				<p>The Beagle is an affectionate and easygoing dog that is the perfect companion for big families and new dog owners alike. Originally bred to live in packs as hunting dogs, Beagles do well in active homes where someone is always around. Known for their soft floppy ears, big brown eyes, and loving nature it is no surprise that the Beagle has long been one of the most popular hound dogs around the world. Gentle and outgoing, these adorable dogs make a great addition to any family. Read on to learn more about the Beagle. This breed is known for their mild nature and love of human company, and they often bark when theyâ€™re lonely. While the Beagle can make a great watchdog and will often let you know when a stranger is near, their affectionate nature does not make them a good guard dog. Choose the Beagle for his loving and loyal personality, not his ability to offer protection.</p>
